# GW2OathGuildPointCalculator

This is a quick calculator for assigning guild members points according to the number of in-game decorations they donate to the guild. This application uses API requests against the in-game guild upgrade log to determine how many and which types of items the member contributes to the guild. A total point value is then calculated based on individual item values assigned by the guild leader according to the rarity of each item. The user can specify the log id from the last time the application was run in order to only get newer entries. This is a manual process due to platform limitations. 

This application is currently live: https://oathoftheexiled.enjin.com/guildpointcalculator
